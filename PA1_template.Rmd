# Reproducible Research: Peer Assessment 1


## Loading and preprocessing the data

```{r echo=TRUE}
library(plyr)
activity <- read.csv('activity.csv')
stepsbydate <- ddply(activity, .(date), summarize, total=sum(steps,na.rm=TRUE))
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r echo=TRUE}
plot(stepsbydate$date, stepsbydate$total)
meansteps <- mean(stepsbydate$total,na.rm=TRUE)
mediansteps <- median(stepsbydate$total, na.rm=TRUE)
```
Mean steps per day is `r meansteps`.  
Median steps per day is `r mediansteps`.

## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
